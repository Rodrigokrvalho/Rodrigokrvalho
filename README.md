My favorite language is definitely Javascript, especially Typescript, but I started learning Java where I learned the basic concepts of programming. I've been studying programming since 2019, I've created mobile apps with Android Studio, web pages with Vuejs, Reactjs and Nextjs, backend with Nestjs and Expressjs, a brief stint in PHP at that time and I played with game development with Unity in C#. 

*Technology is my passion and understanding how things work is my life goal.*
